# Revenue Insights Hospitality Domain

Data

The data was picked from Code basics project challenge wherein the dataset was provided and asked to help the revenue team to provide insights to make actionable business decisions.

Introduction

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

Interesting learning:

1. WoW (week on week) change measure is a very useful measure which tells us the change in business week on week basis.
2. Used tooltip with the KPI's to show trends on weekly basis for all the months.
3. How conditional formating can be used to create interactive dashboard (week on week basis increase and decrease in KPI's).
